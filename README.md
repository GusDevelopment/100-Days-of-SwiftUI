# 100-Days-of-SwiftUI
This is a 100 day course on SwiftUI by HackingWithSwift

I am intrigued with the idea of developing an app. This is my chance to learn how to make an app using Swift. My goal is to learn from these lessons and create an app of my own. For a work creative assignment, I actually used what I learned and made an education app. I was impressed by how much I have learned. Now when I look at an iOS app, I can understand what is a picker or a list.

Here is a list of what has been accomplished so far.
